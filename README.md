## About
Even though there are hundreds of resources out there (too many to keep track of), I will try to limit them to 3 to 5 per category to ensure you get the most valuable and relevant resources out there. Also, the whole point is to help you avoid getting overwhelmed with too many choices

**How is curation done?** Curation is based on thorough research, community contributions and my years of experience as a Data Scientist.
**Are all resource free?** Most resources here will be free, but I will also include paid alternatives if they are truly valuable to your career development.
