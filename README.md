# About
Even though there are hundreds of resources out there (too many to keep track of), I will try to limit them to a maximum of 5 per category to ensure you get the most valuable and relevant resources out there, plus, the whole point is to help you avoid getting overwhelmed with too many choices.

## FAQs
**How is curation done?** Curation is based on thorough research, community contributions, and my years of experience as a Data Scientist.
**Are all resources free?** Most resources here will be free, but I will also include paid alternatives if they are truly valuable to your career development.
